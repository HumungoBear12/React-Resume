      <hr />
      <p>I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong academic background and diverse hands-on experience in the field. My journey began at Sandra Day O'Connor High School, where I studied from 2017 to 2021. During my high school years, I developed a keen interest in technology, which led me to pursue full stack development at West-MEC from 2020 to 2022.

      <br/>
      Following this, I enrolled at Grand Canyon University in the fall of 2022 to pursue a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, which I am set to complete in the fall of 2024. Throughout my educational journey, I have earned several industry-recognized certifications that underscore my expertise and commitment to the field. These include the Fortinet Certified Associate in Cybersecurity, Fortinet Certified Fundamentals in Cybersecurity, AWS Security Essentials, AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, and the Microsoft Technology Associate: Web Development Fundamentals (MTA).

      In addition to my academic and certification accomplishments, I have been working as a Cyber Security Analyst at Virtix Health since September 2022. This role has provided me with invaluable experience in real-world cybersecurity practices. My responsibilities include utilizing a range of security tools and platforms such as CrowdStrike, Cylance, SentinelOne, Inky, Clearwater, Proofpoint, AWS, and Azure. My work involves threat hunting, malware analysis, IT support, OKTA administration, and vulnerability management and assessment.

      Currently, I am working towards obtaining my Security+ certification, which will further validate my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity. My dedication to continuous learning and professional development drives me to pursue additional certifications and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
      <br/>

      In summary, my comprehensive education, practical experience, and a strong set of technical skills make me a well-rounded cybersecurity professional, poised to contribute effectively to any team or organization.
